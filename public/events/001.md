# MSMC TRANSPORT CARRIER // 5.24.5012U
An experimental ship created by SSC’s biowarfare division has crash landed while transiting through a minor border system  on the planet **DORADA**. You are new recruits of Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company, and have been put together under a Commanding Officer operating as your handler, Callsign **STARLINER**. 

Your ship is the only one close enough to reach the ruins of the SSC vessel before local subversive elements may have a chance to recover high level **CORPSEC** research material. The damage they could do with that kind of tech is incalculable.
