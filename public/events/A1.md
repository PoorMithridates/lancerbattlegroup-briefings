# UCS BATTLEGROUP PALLADIUM, DAWNLINE SHORE, BLINK-1 // 5.26.5021u
With the sucessful evacuation of **NEW MADRASSA**, Union fleetgroup elements have been tasked with eliminating strategic targets within the system as part of **OPERATION WINGCLIPPER**. 

The primary objective of **BATTLEGROUP PALLADIUM** is the **HARRISON ARMORY** orbital manufacturing station **MAQUINERA** over **DS1- HARRISON'S WORLD**, which provides local manufacturing of mechanized battle chassis and armaments supplied to domestic belligerents. 

**COMMODORE ARIM**, the commanding officer of **HARRISON ARMORY'S 17TH DELICATE OPERATIONS GROUP** is operating in the region, and is believed to be coordinating picket groups for the station. He is wanted for questioning by DoJ/HR, and a warrant for his arrest has been issued.
