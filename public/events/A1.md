# UCS BATTLEGROUP PALLADIUM, DAWNLINE SHORE, BLINK-1 // 5.26.5021u
With the sucessful destruction of **EL MAQUINERA**, Union fleetgroup elements have withdrawn back to their base at the station **BLINK ONE** to find it reeling from a terrorist strike performed by agents of **HARRISON ARMORY'S 17TH DELICATE OPERATIONS GROUP**.

The primary objective of **BATTLEGROUP PALLADIUM** is recovering a high value target kidnapped during the attack. They race toward isolated space at the edge of the system where it is believed the kidnappers are attempting to hand off their quarry.  

**COMMODORE ARIM**, the commanding officer of **HARRISON ARMORY'S 17TH DELICATE OPERATIONS GROUP** is likely in pursuit, intent on recovering his prize and securing a key victory over **UNION'S** forces in the region.
